@  File: plot-s4.rsp
@
@  Response file for steady state flow sample problem: run 4
@
@  This response file shows the responses necessary to plot a single time step
@  (time step number 2, which displays the plume after 10 years of releasing
@  particles). You can plot other time steps by substituting the appropriate
@  time step number.
@
@  Another way to plot additional time steps quickly is to execute MODPATH-PLOT
@  and specifiy the name of this file when prompted for the name of a response
@  file. The text string "(?)" has been added to the prompt termination lines
@  for the prompts that ask for the time step number and the title. Whenever
@  MODPATH or MODPATH-PLOT finds the character string, "(?)", in a prompt
@  termination line, that prompt is issued interactively. Otherwise, responses
@  are read directly from the file. In this case, you will be prompted to enter
@  a title and the number of the time step that you want to plot.
