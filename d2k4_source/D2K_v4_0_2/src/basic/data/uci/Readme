  This is the UCI Repository Of Machine Learning Databases and Domain Theories
                             4 December 1995
              ftp.ics.uci.edu: pub/machine-learning-databases

          Librarian: Patrick M. Murphy (ml-repository@ics.uci.edu)
                  111 databases and domain theories (36MB)
  ============================================================================

This directory contains data sets and domain theories (the latter have been
annotated as such in the following brief listing) that have been or can be
used to evaluate learning algorithms. Each data file (*.data) contains
individual records described in terms of attribute-value pairs.  The
corresponding *.info file contains voluminous documentation.  (Some files
_generate_ databases; they do not have *.data files.)

In addition to data sets and domain theories, the "utilities/" directory
contains utilities that you may find useful when using datasets in this
repository.

The contents of this repository can be viewed and remotely copied over
the web.  The address is http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html.  
Alternatively, the contents of this repository can be remotely copied via 
ftp to ftp.ics.uci.edu.  Enter "anonymous" for user id, and e-mail address 
(user@host) for password.  These databases can be found by executing 
"cd pub/machine-learning-databases".

Notes:
 1. We're always looking for addition	al databases, which can be
    written to the sub-directory named "/incoming". Please send yours, with 
    documentation.  Thanks -- See DOC-REQUIREMENTS for suggested documentation 
    procedures. Presently, most databases have the following format: 1 
    instance per line, no spaces, commas separate attribute values, and 
    missing values are denoted by "?".  Also, please notify the site librarian 
    (ml-repository@ics.uci.edu) after making a donation.

 2. Ivan Bratko requested that the databases he donated from the Ljubljana
    Oncology Institute (e.g., breast-cancer, lymphography, and primary-tumor)
    have restricted access. We are allowed to share them with academic
    institutions upon request. These databases (like several others) require
    providing proper citations be made in published articles that use them.
    Citation requirements are in each database's corresponding *.doc file.
    To access any of these databases, send email to ml-repository@ics.uci.edu.
    To aid you in deciding if you want any of these databases, the 
    documentation files are available.

 3. An archive server may now be used to recieve via e-mail files in this
    repository.  Installed on ics, it provides email access to files in
    our anonymous ftp/uucp area (~ftp).  If people have no other access to
    our archives, then they can send mail to:

	archive-server@ics.uci.edu

    Commands to the server may be given in the body.  Some commands are:

	help
	send <archive> <file>
	find <archive> <string>

    The help command replies with a useful help message.

If you publish material based on databases obtained from this repository,
then, in your acknowledgements, please note the assistance you received by
using this repository.  Thanks -- this will help others to obtain the same
data sets and replicate your experiments.  We suggest the following pseudo-APA
reference format for referring to this repository (LaTeX'd):
