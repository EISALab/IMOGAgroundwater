Defines a standardized table interface to use in D2K modules.  Tables are composed of rows and columns.  Tables are immutable Objects.  The data contained within a Table cannot be mutated.  The MutableTable interface defines methods to modify the contents of a Table.<br><br>
Several different types of Tables are defined to provide a standard mechanism for the model-building process.  ExampleTable provides a means to define the inputs and outputs of a data set.  ExampleTable also provides a procedure to designate training and testing sets within the Table.  These subsets are reflected in TrainTable and TestTable.  PredictionTable provides an empty Column a model to insert its predictions.  An empty Column will be created for each output in the training data set.
