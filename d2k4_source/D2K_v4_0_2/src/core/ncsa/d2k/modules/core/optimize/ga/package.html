<H1>D2K Genetic Algorithm Implementation</H1>
<p>This package contains those elements which implement the basis of all genetic 
  algorithms in D2K. This package was designed to be both easy to use and extensible. 
  In order to solve most problem some development will be required. Many of the 
  modules implemented in this package will be useful in the great majority of 
  applications.</p>
<p>For more information on genetic algorithms, see Goldbergs &quot;Genetic Algorithms 
  in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning&quot;.</p>
<h2>Populations and Individuals</h2>
<p>There are two classes which are at the core of the GAs functionality: the <code>Population</code> 
  and the <code>Individual</code>. Population is abstract, it the subclasses which 
  will determine how the particular experiment is to work. </p>
<p>The <code>Population</code> object is responsible for managing the population. 
  There are methods to generate strings which can be printed or written to a file, 
  to compare the fitnesses of individuals, to define the traits of the genes in 
  the chromosomes, and so on. There is one abstract method which must be provided 
  by subclasses. This method, called <code>evalute</code>, will compute the objective 
  values (usually, this value is considered the fitness value) for the population. 
  The population also contains a variety of properties which are typically set 
  by the module that creates the population.</p>
<p>The <code>Individual</code> is a very simple class that provides methods that 
  perform crossover, cloning and mutation on the individual. It will also carry 
  the fitness value for the individual. One existing subclass <code>BinaryIndividual</code> 
  which is instantiable. This individual is represented by a binary string of 
  digits as is usually the case in a traditional GA. However, some current implementations 
  of genetic algorithms are leaning toward a more appropriate representation of 
  an individual which may consist of some combinary of floating point and integer 
  values. Such representations will require alternative subclasses of <code>Individual</code>. 
  <code>NumericIndividual</code> is one such subclass which represents population 
  members as an array of double precision floating point values.</p>
<h2>Providing Population Subclasses</h2>
<p>Step one is to develop a subclass of population which provides the appropriate 
  methods. In the demos package (ncsa.d2k.modules.demos.ga), we find sublcass 
  of population called <code>F1Population</code>. Let's disect this class and 
  see how it works.</p>
<p><code>F1Population</code> subclasses <code>BinaryPopulation</code>, the superclass 
  of all populations which represent individuals as a string of bits. This population 
  also implements the <code>Crowding</code> interface. The crowding interface 
  requires one method, crowding, which computes the crowding distance between 
  individuals. Also provided, of course, is the evaluation function evaluateIndividual 
  which actually computes the objective value (in this problem we can also refer 
  to this as the fitness value). I won't go into the details of what this evaluation 
  function is here, but it is important to note that we can either maximize or 
  minimize this function with equal probabilities of success. The properties of 
  the module that creates the population typically have properties (best and worst 
  fitness) which will be used to determine if we max or min the function. For 
  simple populations of binary individuals this is all we need to do. Notice in 
  the constructor the number of genes is passed in as a parameter. This parameter 
  will need to be supplied by the module that creates the population.</p>
<p>For populations of <code>NumericIndividuals</code>, we provide one additional 
  method which returns an array of <code>Trait</code> objects. There is one trait 
  object in the array for each of the genes present in the chromosome, and the 
  trait defines the range of values (doubles) which this trait may take on. Each 
  trait also has an increment (currently ignored) which defines the discrete values 
  the trait may take on within that range. For an example numeric population, 
  take a look at the <code>F1NumericPopulation</code> class in the demos.</p>
<h2>Multi-Modal Problems</h2>
<p>There is a class of problem which may have more that one solution, or solutions 
  of differing value. For problems like this, populations may converge too rapidly 
  to traverse the solution space adequately. It is important to be able to provide 
  some mechanism for maintaining population diversity in cases like this. <i>Niching</i> 
  techniques can help to maintain populations diversity. Niching techniques typically 
  provide some mechanism by which like individuals are penalized during selection 
  so that more dissimilar individuals may flourish.</p>
<p>So these niching techniques require a method to be provided which measures 
  the similarity between individuals. There are some standard measures (Hamming 
  distance for binary individuals, and Euclidean distance for numeric), however 
  there are a wide variety of techniques that can be employed. The <code>Crowding</code> 
  interface must be implemented by populations which are to use niching techniques. 
  The <code>crowding</code> function of this interface is the only requirement.</p>
<h2>Multi-Objective Problems</h2>
<p>Even cooler yet is a class of problem where there is no single objective, but 
  several. For example, imagine that you want to minimize a cost function while 
  maximizing a value function. Problems of this nature quite often have several 
  solutions, so as with Multi-modal problems, we need to maintain a diverse population 
  to more thoroughly explore the decision space.</p>
<p>We provide a mechanism based on NSGA-II (Deb, et al. &quot;A Fast Elitist Non-Dominated 
  Sorting Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization: NSGA-II&quot;) which 
  will search for individuals which are not dominated by other individuals. One 
  individual dominates another if it is at least as good in all objectives, but 
  better in at least one. Although interesting and useful information, the details 
  of this mechanism should not be imperative to the developer in most cases. It 
  should be sufficient to know that individuals are scored on the basis of how 
  many individuals dominate them, and that by using this mechanism we maintain 
  a more diverse population allowing one to more fully examine search space to 
  find a diverse set of many solutions to multi-objective problems.</p>
<p><code>NsgaPopulation</code> is a population class which implements most of 
  the NSGA-II functionality. Subclasses must provide that functionality required 
  of NumericPopulation abstract class plus one additional method. The <code>defineObjectiveConstraints</code> 
  method returns a list of <code>ObjectiveConstraint</code> objects. ObjectiveConstraint 
  objects define the possible range of values an objective can take one, and also 
  if we are maximizing or minimizing the objective. A public static method of 
  this class called getObjConstraint will return an instance of the ObjectiveConstraint 
  object. This is done so that an appropriate subclass can be returned that does 
  either minimization or maximization. See the ncsa.d2k.modules.demos.ga.emo.ncsa.MOP2Population 
  object for an example of how to do this.</p>
<h2>Generating Populations</h2>
<p>To use the GA modules, a population object will have to be instantiated in 
  some way. Since the population holds some important properties of the experiment, 
  namely population size, number of generations and, best fitness, worst fitness 
  and target fitness) a superclass is provided which includes these properties. 
  The <code>PopulationPrep</code> module can be subclassed by any module which 
  is to create a population.</p>
<p>Subclasses of <code>PopulationPrep</code> will generate a subclass of <code>Population</code> 
  that implements the evaluation function appropriately for the application the 
  developer wishes to implement as described above. The subclass may provide a 
  numeric or binary population, this will note affect the way the other modules 
  operate on the population. Again, there are several examples in the demo package.</p>
<h2>Other Pieces</h2>
<p>Crossover, Mutate, Evaluate and Measure modules should all work for most applications. 
  How crossover and mutate operations on a individual is hidden in the <code>Individual</code> 
  implementation, evalute is supported by the <code>Population</code> implementation.</p>
<p><code>SelectionModule</code> is actually an abstract superclass. In order to 
  implement some type of selection, the developer must provide an implementation 
  of an abstract method called <code>compute</code>. This method is passed an 
  array of integers whose contents are undefined. The returned array should contain 
  the indices of those individuals which are carried into the next generation. 
  Note there can be repetition in this array. Several types of selection are provided 
  in the selection package.</p>
<p>There is another module in the niching package which warrents mention here. 
  It is a deterministic crowding module (Mahfoud, 1993), but the important thing 
  to note here is that it performs it's own selection, crossover and niching to 
  preserve diversity in multimodal problems (problems with more than one possible 
  solution).</p>
<p>There is also a debugging module provided which will print out a population 
  whenever it is invoked.</p>
